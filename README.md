**About ject**
================

ject is a decentralized project management platform, designed to enable teams to plan and manage projects without the need for central authority or third-party services. We aim to provide a secure, private, and decentralized way to collaborate on projects.

**Features**
==========

* **Offline First**: Start planning projects without an internet connection.
* **Decentralized Project Management**: Manage projects among peers, without connecting to a big bad centralized server.
* **Organization-Based Projects**: Create and manage projects as a team or organization.
* **Kaioken, ShadCN, and Desktop-First**: Built using the Kaioken framework, with ShadCN for a pretty cute management ui.

**Technologies Used**
=====================

* Frontend: Kaioken
* UI Library: ShadCN
* Database & Networking: GunJs

**Getting Started**
================

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ject.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
3. Run the application: `npm start` (or `yarn start`)

**Contributing**

**License**
=========

ject is licensed under the GPL License. See [LICENSE](https://github.com/ject/blob/master/LICENSE) for more information.

**Edge Cases and Considerations**
=====================================

* **Scalability**: As the number of projects and peers grows, scalability may become an issue (_doubtful_).
* **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across all edge nodes is crucial to maintain the integrity of the project management system.
* **Security**: Implementing robust security measures is essential to protect sensitive project information from unauthorized access.

I hope this README file helps you document your project!
